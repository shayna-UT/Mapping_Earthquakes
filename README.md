# Mapping_Earthquakes

Created interactive world maps using GeoJSON data, the d3 and Leaflet libraries, and a Mapbox API.

### Earthquake_Challenge
An informative and easy to use world map displaying interactive earthquake and tectonic plate data has been created. The latest earthquake data has been provided by the United States Geological Survey (https://www.usgs.gov/natural-hazards/earthquake-hazards/data-tools). On the map, the magnitude and location of each earthquake within the past 7 days are shown as a popup marker. The diameter and color of each popup marker reflect the magnitude of the earthquake; earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in color. A legend is also provided on the map for reference. In addition, to illustrate the relationship between frequency and location of seismic activities and tectonic plates, fault lines have been added to the map. Different map views have also been provided as toggle options.
